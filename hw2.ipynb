    "So far, we've considered the simple case of a ChR2 current whose conductance is directly proportional to the ChR2 photon absorption rate. However in reality, the influence of photon absorption on ChR2 conductance is more complex, and can be captured by a multi-state kinetic scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this homework, we will assume that ChR2 can transition between 3 different states (see [Stefanescu 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-013-9888-4) paper, section 2.2.1):\n",
    "- In the absence of optostimulation, ChR2 molecules are assumed to be in state in a closed state *C*.\n",
    "- Upon illumination, the ChR2 molecules undergo conformational changes and transition to an open state *O*\n",
    "- ChR2 molecules then spontaneously decays into a closed but desensitized state *D*, in which they are not available to photoswitch on illumination.\n",
    "- Finally, following a prolonged recovery time period, which is much slower than the time scales involved in the light induced `C -> O` and the spontaneous `O -> D` transitions, the protein returns to the conformation of the closed state *C*.\n",

    "This 3-states configuration can be captured by the following transition rates kinetic model:\n",

    "with, at all times: $C + O + D = 1$.\n",
